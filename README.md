# TreeMap Filesystem Visualizer
This project implements a TreeMap algorithm to visualize the contents of your computer's filesystem. 
By exploring your directories, you'll uncover surprising insights about old files and their sizes, giving you a fresh perspective on your storage.

## Features
  - Directory Selection: Users can select any directory through a file chooser dialog, allowing for dynamic visualization of filesystem contents.
  - Dynamic TreeMap Rendering: When a directory is selected, a TreeMap is generated, representing the folder structure and file sizes visually.
  - Customizable Color Schemes: Users can modify the color scheme based on various criteria:
    - File Type: Different colors for documents, spreadsheets, images, audio, etc.
    - File Age: Color coding based on the last modified date.
    - File Permissions: Visual distinctions based on access permissions.
  - Random Colors: A fun, meaningless option for aesthetic variation.
  - Tooltips: When hovering over a file in the TreeMap, a tooltip displays the absolute path and size of the file for easy identification.
